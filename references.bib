Our model of {AlgnpSq} uses the geometrically convenient framework of factorization algebras. The main result is that {AlgnpSq} is fully n-dualizable, verifying a conjecture of Lurie. Moreover, we unpack the consequences for a natural class of fully extended topological ﬁeld theories and explore pn ` 1q-dualizability.},

This includes the case of semisimple modular tensor categories, but also non-semisimple examples such as categories of representations of the small quantum group at good roots of unity. Via the cobordism hypothesis, we obtain new invertible 4-dimensional framed topological ﬁeld theories, which we regard as a non-semisimple framed version of the Crane-Yetter-Kauﬀman invariants, after Freed–Teleman and Walker’s construction in the semisimple case. More generally, we characterize invertibility for E1- and E2algebras in an arbitrary symmetric monoidal ∞-category, and we conjecture a similar characterization of invertible En-algebras for any n. Finally, we propose the Picard group of {BrTens} as a generalization of the Witt group of non-degenerate braided fusion categories, and pose a number of open questions about it.},

In this paper we give several sufficient conditions under which a rational vertex operator algebra is regular. We prove that the moonshine module vertex operator algebra \$V{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}natural\},\$ the vertex operator algebras \$L(l,0)\$ associated with the integrable representations of affine algebras of level \$l,\$ the vertex operator algebras \$L(c\_\{p,q\},0)\$ associated with irreducible highest weight representations for the discrete series of the Virasoro algebra and the vertex operator algebras \$V\_L\$ associated with positive definite even lattices \$L\$ are regular. Our result for \$L(l,0)\$ implies that any restricted integrable module of level \$l\$ for the corresponding affine Lie algebra is a direct sum of irreducible highest weight integrable modules. The space \$V\_L\$ in general is a vertex algebra if \$L\$ is not positive definite. In this case we establish the complete reducibility of any weak module.},

(ii) Every N-gradable weak V -module is completely reducible. (iii) V is C2-coﬁnite. (In the presence of Condition (i), Conditions (ii) and (iii) are equivalent to a single condition, namely, that every weak V -module is completely reducible.) Then the matrices formed by the fusion rules among the irreducible V -modules are diagonalized by the matrix given by the action of the modular transformation τ → −1/τ on the space of characters of irreducible V -modules. Using this result, we obtain the Verlinde formula for the fusion rules. We also prove that the matrix associated to the modular transformation τ → −1/τ is symmetric.},

	abstract = {"The study of the mapping class group Mod(S) is a classical topic that is experiencing a renaissance. It lies at the juncture of geometry, topology, and group theory. This book explains as many important theorems, examples, and techniques as possible, quickly and directly, while at the same time giving full details and keeping the text nearly self-contained. The book is suitable for graduate students.The book begins by explaining the main group-theoretical properties of Mod(S), from finite generation by Dehn twists and low-dimensional homology to the Dehn-Nielsen-Baer theorem. Along the way, central objects and tools are introduced, such as the Birman exact sequence, the complex of curves, the braid group, the symplectic representation, and the Torelli group. The book then introduces Teichm©ơller space and its geometry, and uses the action of Mod(S) on it to prove the Nielsen-Thurston classification of surface homeomorphisms. Topics include the topology of the moduli space of Riemann surfaces, the connection with surface bundles, pseudo-Anosov theory, and Thurston's approach to the classification"--},

We denote by (M\_\{S,g\},{\textbackslash}xi\_\{S,g\})\$ the contact 3-manifold compatible with the open book (S,g). In this article, we construct a Stein cobordism from the contact connected sum (M\_\{S,h\},{\textbackslash}xi\_\{S,h\}) \# (M\_\{S,g\},{\textbackslash}xi\_\{S,g\}) to (M\_\{S,hg\},{\textbackslash}xi\_\{S,hg\}), for any two boundary-fixing diffeomorphisms h and g. This cobordism accounts for the comultiplication map on Heegaard Floer homology discovered in an earlier paper by the author, and it illuminates several geometrically interesting monoids in the mapping class group of S. We derive some consequences for the fillability of contact manifolds obtained as cyclic branched covers of transverse knots.},

To facilitate this and applications we define the notion of a rational open book decomposition that generalizes the standard notion of open book decomposition and allows one to more easily study surgeries on transverse knots. As a corollary to our investigation we are able to show there are Stein fillable contact structures supported by open books whose monodromies cannot be written as a product of positive Dehn twists. We also exhibit several monoids in the mapping class group of a surface that have contact geometric significance.},
